The executable file can be generated with the "make" command

running the executable file will launch the shell which can process basic commands such as 'ls' and 'cd'.
background processes can be ran by calling 'bg' before any command, and the progress of background processes can be checked with the 'bglist' command.
the program can be stopped by using the 'exit' command

there are comments in the ssi.c file describing what the code is doing in more detail.
